This project aims to provide an effective APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) service at an extremely low cost, using just a NodeMCU (ESP8266), a battery, and a simple OLED display. Thanks to the power and flexibility of NodeMCU, it is possible to transmit location data to the APRS network and display it on a small OLED screen at the same time.

This system can be used in various applications, such as location tracking, environmental data collection, or amateur radio projects. For amateur radio enthusiasts, it allows for developing vehicle-mounted or portable APRS solutions by transmitting GPS locations to an APRS server.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this project is that it is programmed using MicroPython. MicroPython is a lightweight Python interpreter that runs on embedded systems, simplifying and speeding up the coding process. Instead of dealing with complex software, this solution leverages the simplicity and flexibility of Python.

In summary, this low-cost APRS system is energy-efficient enough to run on a battery and offers a fully functional solution using only the NodeMCU. Itâ€™s a perfect alternative for those in the amateur radio community looking for a simple, portable, and inexpensive solution.
